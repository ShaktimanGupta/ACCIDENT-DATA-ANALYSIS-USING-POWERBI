## 📊 Project Overview

The **Accident Data Analysis Dashboard** is a Power BI project designed to visualize and analyze accident trends across different road types, regions, and time periods.  
It provides valuable insights into the causes and patterns of accidents, helping stakeholders and policymakers take data-driven decisions for road safety improvements.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze accident data by **vehicle type, road type, and month**.  
- Compare **urban vs rural** accident rates.  
- Study **year-wise** and **severity-wise** trends (Fatal, Serious, Slight).  
- Identify the most accident-prone road types and months.  

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

- **Total Accidents Recorded:** **683K**  
- **Urban Areas:** 59.9% of total accidents  
- **Rural Areas:** 40.1% of total accidents  
- **Most Accident-Prone Road Type:** *Single Carriageway (0.51M)*  
- **Least Accident-Prone Road Type:** *Slip Roads & One-Way Streets (0.01M)*  
- **Peak Month:** *November (61.3K accidents)*  
- **Lowest Month:** *March (53.5K accidents)*
